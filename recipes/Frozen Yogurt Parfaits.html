        <h1>Description</h1> 
        <h4>"Parfait" does mean "perfect" in French, which is very fitting, because these frozen yogurt parfaits are perfectly easy,
             and are a perfect make-ahead frozen summer treat.</h4>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <h4>For the Parfaits:</h4>
            <li>3/2 cups raspberries, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup blueberries, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>3/2 cups granola</li>
            <h4>For the Frozen Yogurt:</h4>
            <li>2 cups full-fat plain Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            
            <li>Combine raspberries and Â½ cup white sugar in a bowl. Crush with a potato masher into a puree. Cover and let sit out for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Pass berry puree through a fine mesh strainer to remove seeds. Add blueberries, stir, and keep in the refrigerator until needed.</li>
            <li>Whisk yogurt, vanilla, lemon zest, and sugar for frozen yogurt together in a bowl until sugar dissolves and the mixture is light and fluffy. 
                Transfer into a piping bag and refrigerate until needed.
            </li>
            <h4>To Build Parfaits:</h4>
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons of granola into an 8-ounce jar, or similar vessel. Top with 2 tablespoons of the fruit mixture. 
                Try to make sure some of the fruit sauce is touching the glass so you can see the layers when frozen.
                 Top with 2 heaping tablespoons of the yogurt mixture. Repeat twice more for a total of 3 layers. 
                 Top can be garnished with any remaining fruit and sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Freeze until frozen solid, about 8 hours, or overnight.</li>
        </ol>
